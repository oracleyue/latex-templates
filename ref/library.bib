@article{Ghahramani2015,
abstract = {How can a machine learn from experience? Probabilistic modelling provides a framework for understanding what learning is, and has therefore emerged as one of the principal theoretical and practical approaches for designing machines that learn from data acquired through experience. The probabilistic framework, which describes how to represent and manipulate uncertainty about models and predictions, has a central role in scientific data analysis, machine learning, robotics, cognitive science and artificial intelligence. This Review provides an introduction to this framework, and discusses some of the state-of-the-art advances in the field, namely, probabilistic programming, Bayesian optimization, data compression and automatic model discovery.},

abstract = {A major challenge in the study of dynamical systems is that of model discovery: turning data into models that are not just predictive, but provide insight into the nature of the underlying dynamical system that generated the data. This problem is made more difficult by the fact that many systems of interest exhibit diverse behaviors across multiple time scales. We introduce a number of data-driven strategies for discovering nonlinear multiscale dynamical systems and their embeddings from data. We consider two canonical cases: (i) systems for which we have full measurements of the governing variables, and (ii) systems for which we have incomplete measurements. For systems with full state measurements, we show that the recent sparse identification of nonlinear dynamical systems (SINDy) method can discover governing equations with relatively little data and introduce a sampling method that allows SINDy to scale efficiently to problems with multiple time scales. Specifically, we can discover distinct governing equations at slow and fast scales. For systems with incomplete observations, we show that the Hankel alternative view of Koopman (HAVOK) method, based on time-delay embedding coordinates, can be used to obtain a linear model and Koopman invariant measurement system that nearly perfectly captures the dynamics of nonlinear quasiperiodic systems. We introduce two strategies for using HAVOK on systems with multiple time scales. Together, our approaches provide a suite of mathematical strategies for reducing the data required to discover and model nonlinear multiscale systems.},

abstract = {Resistance spot welding is one of the primary means of joining sheet metal in the automotive industry and other industries. The demand for improved corrosion resistance has led the automotive industry to increasingly use zinc coated steel in auto body construction. One of the major concerns associated with welding coated steel is the mushrooming effect (the increase in the electrode diameter due to deposition of copper into the spot surface) resulting in reduced current density and undersized welds (cold welds). The most common approach to this problem is based on the use of simple unconditional incremental algorithms (steppers) for preprogrammed current scheduling. In this paper, an intelligent algorithm is proposed for adjusting the amount of current to compensate for the electrodes degradation. The algorithm works as a fuzzy logic controller using a set of engineering rules with fuzzy predicates that dynamically adapt the secondary current to the state of the weld process. The state is identified by indirectly estimating two of the main process characteristics - weld quality and expulsion rate. A soft sensor for indirect estimation of the weld quality employing a learning vector quantization (LVQ) type classifier is designed to provide a real time approximate assessment of the weld nugget diameter. Another soft sensing algorithm is applied to predict the impact of changes in current on the expulsion rate of the weld process. By maintaining the expulsion rate just below a minimal acceptable level, robust process control performance and satisfactory weld quality are achieved. The intelligent constant current control for resistance spot welding is implemented and validated on a medium frequency direct current (MFDC) constant current weld controller. Results demonstrate a substantial improvement of weld quality and reduction of process variability due to the proposed new control algorithm.},

abstract = {The identification of effective connectivity from time-series data such as electroencephalogram (EEG) or time-resolved function magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recordings is an important problem in brain imaging. One commonly used approach to inference effective connectivity is based on vector autoregressive models and the concept of Granger causality. However, this probabilistic concept of causality can lead to spurious causalities in the presence of latent variables. Recently, graphical models have been used to discuss problems of causal inference for multivariate data. In this paper, we extend these concepts to the case of time-series and present a graphical approach for discussing Granger-causal relationships among multiple time-series. In particular, we propose a new graphical representation that allows the characterization of spurious causality and, thus, can be used to investigate spurious causality. The method is demonstrated with concurrent EEG and fMRI recordings which are used to investigate the interrelations between the alpha rhythm in the EEG and blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) responses in the fMRI. The results confirm previous findings on the location of the source of the EEG alpha rhythm.},

abstract = {Dynamics of complex systems is often driven by large and intricate networks of microscopic interactions, whose sheer size obfuscates understanding. With limited experimental data, many parameters of such dynamics are unknown, and thus detailed, mechanistic models risk overfitting and making faulty predictions. At the other extreme, simple ad hoc models often miss defining features of the underlying systems. Here we develop an approach that instead constructs phenomenological, coarse-grained models of network dynamics that automatically adapt their complexity to the available data. Such adaptive models produce accurate predictions even when microscopic details are unknown. The approach is computationally tractable, even for a relatively large number of dynamical variables. Using simulated data, it correctly infers the phase space structure for planetary motion, avoids overfitting in a biological signalling system and produces accurate predictions for yeast glycolysis with tens of data points and over half of the interacting species unobserved.},

The theorem states that any bandlimited baseband signal within ±0.637 can be represented by a pulsewidth modulation (PWM) waveform with unit amplitude. The number of pulses in the waveform is equal to the number of Nyquist samples and the peak constraint is independent of whether the waveform is two-level or three-level. The proof of the sampling theorem uses a simple iterative technique that is guaranteed to converge to the exact PWM representation whenever it exists. The paper goes on to develop a practical matrix based iterative technique to generate the PWM waveform that is guaranteed to converge exponentially. The peak constraint in the theorem is only a sufficient condition. In fact, many signals with higher peaks, e.g., lower than Nyquist frequency sinusoids, can be accurately represented by a PWM waveform.},

@article{Yuan2015,
abstract = {Motivated by the fact that transfer functions do not contain structural information about networks (dependency of state variables), dynamical structure functions were introduced to capture causal relationships between measured nodes in networks. From the dynamical structure functions, (a) we show that the actual number of hidden states can be larger than the number of hidden states estimated from the corresponding transfer function; (b) we can obtain partial information about the true state-space equation, which cannot in general be obtained from the transfer function. Based on these properties, this paper proposes algorithms to find minimal realisations for a given dynamical structure function. This helps to estimate the minimal number of hidden states, to better understand the complexity of the network, and to identify potential targets for new measurements.},

@article{Silver2017,
abstract = {A long-standing goal of artificial intelligence is an algorithm that learns, tabula rasa, superhuman proficiency in challenging domains. Recently, AlphaGo became the first program to defeat a world champion in the game of Go. The tree search in AlphaGo evaluated positions and selected moves using deep neural networks. These neural networks were trained by supervised learning from human expert moves, and by reinforcement learning from self-play. Here we introduce an algorithm based solely on reinforcement learning, without human data, guidance or domain knowledge beyond game rules. AlphaGo becomes its own teacher: a neural network is trained to predict AlphaGo's own move selections and also the winner of AlphaGo's games. This neural network improves the strength of the tree search, resulting in higher quality move selection and stronger self-play in the next iteration. Starting tabula rasa, our new program AlphaGo Zero achieved superhuman performance, winning 100–0 against the previously published, champion-defeating AlphaGo.},

@article{Acary2012,
abstract = {In this paper, a novel discrete-time implementation of sliding-mode control systems is proposed, which fully exploits the multivaluedness of the dynamics on the sliding surface. It is shown to guarantee a smooth stabilization on the discrete sliding surface in the disturbance-free case, hence avoiding the chattering effects due to the time-discretization. In addition, when a disturbance acts on the system, the controller attenuates the disturbance effects on the sliding surface by a factor h (where h is the sampling period). Most importantly, this holds even for large h . The controller is based on an implicit Euler method and is very easy to implement with projections on the interval [-1, 1] (or as the solution of a quadratic program). The zero-order-hold (ZOH) method is also investigated. First- and second-order perturbed systems (with a disturbance satisfying the matching condition) without and with dynamical disturbance compensation are analyzed, with classical and twisting sliding-mode controllers.},

abstract = {A simply structured high-level controller, called a “supervisor”, has recently been proposed in part I of this article (ibid., vol.41, 1996) for the purpose of orchestrating the switching of a sequence of candidate set-point controllers into feedback with an imprecisely modeled SISO process so as to cause the output of the process to approach and track a constant reference input. The process is assumed to be modeled by an SISO linear system whose transfer function is in the union of a number of subclasses, each subclass being small enough so that one of the candidate controllers would solve the set-point tracking problem, if the process transfer function was to be one of the subclass members. This paper proves that without any further modification, the same supervisor described in Part I can also perform this function in the face of norm-bounded unmodeled dynamics, and moreover that none of the signals within the overall system can grow without bound in response to bounded disturbance and noise inputs, whether they are constant or not},

abstract = {Systems as diverse as genetic networks or the World Wide Web are best described as networks with complex topology. A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms: (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to sites that are already well connected. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.},

abstract = {The topology of interactions in network dynamical systems fundamentally underlies their function. Accelerating technological progress creates massively available data about collective nonlinear dynamics in physical, biological, and technological systems. Detecting direct interaction patterns from those dynamics still constitutes a major open problem. In particular, current nonlinear dynamics approaches mostly require to know a priori a model of the (often high dimensional) system dynamics. Here we develop a model-independent framework for inferring direct interactions solely from recording the nonlinear collective dynamics generated. Introducing an explicit dependency matrix in combination with a block-orthogonal regression algorithm, the approach works reliably across many dynamical regimes, including transient dynamics toward steady states, periodic and non-periodic dynamics, and chaos. Together with its capabilities to reveal network (two point) as well as hypernetwork (e.g., three point) interactions, this framework may thus open up nonlinear dynamics options of inferring direct interaction patterns across systems where no model is known.},

In this paper, we discuss the interpretation of the DTF and compare it with other measures for directed relationships. In particular, we show that the DTF does not indicate multivariate or bivariate Granger causality, but that it is closely related to the concept of impulse response function and can be viewed as a spectral measure for the total causal influence from one component to another. Furthermore, we investigate the statistical properties of the DTF and establish a simple significance level for testing for the null hypothesis of no information flow.},

@article{Gong2007,
abstract = {Today, real-time measurement of dynamic power factor in resistance spot welding (RSW) is of increasing importance. On the basis of the welding transformer circuit model, a new method is proposed to measure the peak angle of the welding current and then calculate the dynamic power factor in each half-wave. The tailored sensing and computing system ensures that the measuring method possesses a real-time computational capacity with satisfying accuracy. Since the power factor cannot be represented via an explicit function with respect to measurable parameters, the traditional method(s) has to approximate the power factor angle with a constant phase lag angle and fails to detect its dynamic characteristics. An offline-trained embedded artificial neural network (ANN) successfully realizes the real-time implicit function calculation or estimation. A digital-signal-processor-based RSW monitoring system is developed to perform ANN computation. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method is applicable for measuring the dynamic power factor in single-phase half-wave controlled rectifier circuits},

The set W is a resolving set for G if r(u | W)=r(v | W) implies that u=v for all pairs u,v of vertices of G. The metric dimension dim(G) of G is the minimum cardinality of a resolving set for G. Bounds on dim(G) are presented in terms of the order and the diameter of G. All connected graphs of order n having dimension 1,n−2, or n−1 are determined. A new proof for the dimension of a tree is also presented. From this result sharp bounds on the metric dimension of unicyclic graphs are established. It is shown that dim(H)⩽dim(H×K2)⩽dim(H)+1 for every connected graph H. Moreover, it is shown that for every positive real number $\epsilon$, there exists a connected graph G and a connected induced subgraph H of G such that dim(G)/dim(H){\textless}$\epsilon$.},

@inproceedings{Morse1993,
abstract = {This paper describes a simple, `high-level' controller called a `supervisor' which is capable of switching into feedback with a SISO process, a sequence of linear positioning or set-point controllers from a family {\&}Fscr;C of candidate controllers, so as to cause the output of the process to approach and track a constant reference input. The process is assumed to be modeled by a SISO linear system whose transfer function is in the union of a number of subclasses, each subclass being small enough so that one of the controllers in {\&}Fscr;C would solve the positioning problem, were the process's transfer function to be one of the subclasses members. The supervisor decides which controller to put in feedback with the process, not by an exhaustive search-i.e., by experimentally evaluating each and every candidate controller's performance by briefly applying it to the process-but rather by continuously comparing in real time suitably defined `output estimation errors' generated by the candidate controllers, whether or not they are in feedback with the process. It is shown that under reasonably mild conditions, the supervisor can successfully perform its function in spite of modeling errors, provided the errors are sufficiently small. It is also shown that the supervisor will invariably correctly classify the process in finite time, so long as the reference input is nonzero and the “dc gains” of the “nominal” candidate process model transfer functions are distinct},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Selecting a small number of relevant genes for accurate classification of samples is essential for the development of diagnostic tests. We present the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) method for gene selection and classification of microarray data. Typical gene selection and classification procedures ignore model uncertainty and use a single set of relevant genes (model) to predict the class. BMA accounts for the uncertainty about the best set to choose by averaging over multiple models (sets of potentially overlapping relevant genes). RESULTS: We have shown that BMA selects smaller numbers of relevant genes (compared with other methods) and achieves a high prediction accuracy on three microarray datasets. Our BMA algorithm is applicable to microarray datasets with any number of classes, and outputs posterior probabilities for the selected genes and models. Our selected models typically consist of only a few genes. The combination of high accuracy, small numbers of genes and posterior probabilities for the predictions should make BMA a powerful tool for developing diagnostics from expression data. AVAILABILITY: The source codes and datasets used are available from our Supplementary website.},

@article{Thunberg2015,
abstract = {Transitive consistency is an intrinsic property for collections of linear invertible transformations between Euclidean coordinate frames. In practice, when the transformations are estimated from data, this property is lacking. This work addresses the problem of synchronizing transformations that are not transitively consistent. Once the transformations have been synchronized, they satisfy the transitive consistency condition - a transformation from frame {\$}A{\$} to frame {\$}C{\$} is equal to the composite transformation of first transforming A to B and then transforming B to C. The coordinate frames correspond to nodes in a graph and the transformations correspond to edges in the same graph. Two direct or centralized synchronization methods are presented for different graph topologies; the first one for quasi-strongly connected graphs, and the second one for connected graphs. As an extension of the second method, an iterative Gauss-Newton method is presented, which is later adapted to the case of affine and Euclidean transformations. Two distributed synchronization methods are also presented for orthogonal matrices, which can be seen as distributed versions of the two direct or centralized methods; they are similar in nature to standard consensus protocols used for distributed averaging. When the transformations are orthogonal matrices, a bound on the optimality gap can be computed. Simulations show that the gap is almost right, even for noise large in magnitude. This work also contributes on a theoretical level by providing linear algebraic relationships for transitively consistent transformations. One of the benefits of the proposed methods is their simplicity - basic linear algebraic methods are used, e.g., the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). For a wide range of parameter settings, the methods are numerically validated.},

abstract = {RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a genomic approach for the detection and quantitative analysis of messenger RNA molecules in a biological sample and is useful for studying cellular responses. RNA-seq has fueled much discovery and innovation in medicine over recent years. For practical reasons, the technique is usually conducted on samples comprising thousands to millions of cells. However, this has hindered direct assessment of the fundamental unit of biology—the cell. Since the first single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) study was published in 2009, many more have been conducted, mostly by specialist laboratories with unique skills in wet-lab single-cell genomics, bioinformatics, and computation. However, with the increasing commercial availability of scRNA-seq platforms, and the rapid ongoing maturation of bioinformatics approaches, a point has been reached where any biomedical researcher or clinician can use scRNA-seq to make exciting discoveries. In this review, we present a practical guide to help researchers design their first scRNA-seq studies, including introductory information on experimental hardware, protocol choice, quality control, data analysis and biological interpretation.},

First, I give a theoretical justification by relating the concept to other theoretical causality measures. Second, I outline possible problems with spurious causality and approaches to tackle these problems. Finally, I sketch an identification algorithm that learns causal time-series structures in the presence of latent variables. The description of the algorithm is non-technical and thus accessible to applied scientists who are interested in adopting the method.},

abstract = {The standard continuous time state space model with stochastic disturbances contains the mathematical abstraction of continuous time white noise. To work with well defined, discrete time observations, it is necessary to sample the model with care. The basic issues are well known, and have been discussed in the literature. However, the consequences have not quite penetrated the practice of estimation and identification. One example is that the standard model of an observation, being a snapshot of the current state plus noise independent of the state, cannot be reconciled with this picture. Another is that estimation and identification of time continuous models require a more careful treatment of the sampling formulas. We discuss and illustrate these issues in the current contribution. An application of particular practical importance is the estimation of models based on irregularly sampled observations.},

The general case of both, matched and unmatched disturbances affecting the system is addressed. It is proved that the definition of a suitable sliding manifold and the generation of sliding modes upon it guarantees the minimization of the effect of the disturbance terms, which takes place when the matched disturbances are completely rejected and the unmatched ones are not amplified. A simulation of the proposed technique, applied to a dynamically feedback linearized unicycle, illustrates its effectiveness, even in presence of nonholonomic constraints.},

abstract = {The interplay of mathematical modelling with experiments is one of the central elements in systems biology. The aim of reverse engineering is to infer, analyse and understand, through this interplay, the functional and regulatory mechanisms of biological systems. Reverse engineering is not exclusive of systems biology and has been studied in different areas, such as inverse problem theory, machine learning, nonlinear physics, (bio)chemical kinetics, control theory and optimization, among others. However, it seems that many of these areas have been relatively closed to outsiders. In this contribution, we aim to compare and highlight the different perspectives and contributions from these fields, with emphasis on two key questions: (i) why are reverse engineering problems so hard to solve, and (ii) what methods are available for the particular problems arising from systems biology?},

abstract = {Abstract Most of the currently used techniques for linear system identification are based on classical estimation paradigms coming from mathematical statistics. In particular, maximum likelihood and prediction error methods represent the mainstream approaches to identification of linear dynamic systems, with a long history of theoretical and algorithmic contributions. Parallel to this, in the machine learning community alternative techniques have been developed. Until recently, there has been little contact between these two worlds. The first aim of this survey is to make accessible to the control community the key mathematical tools and concepts as well as the computational aspects underpinning these learning techniques. In particular, we focus on kernel-based regularization and its connections with reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and Bayesian estimation of Gaussian processes. The second aim is to demonstrate that learning techniques tailored to the specific features of dynamic systems may outperform conventional parametric approaches for identification of stable linear systems.},

The strategy of introducing integrators in the input channel is exploited to enlarge the class of tractable control systems. A new reduced-order observer is proposed and conditions are found under which it is proven the convergence to the unique ideal solution of both system and observer. The control problem is solved by forcing a sliding regime for the observer, while satisfying an exponential stability criterion for the observation error state equation.},

abstract = {In this technical note, the problem of inventory management in supply chain is addressed from a control theory perspective. In the analyzed setting, the stock used to satisfy an unknown, time-varying demand can be replenished from several supply sources. The replenishment orders are realized with delay which differs among suppliers and transport alternatives. A novel sliding-mode inventory policy is proposed, which guarantees that the demand is always entirely satisfied from the on-hand stock (yielding zero lost-sales cost), the warehouse capacity is not exceeded (what eliminates the risk of high-cost emergency storage) and ordered goods are not returned to the suppliers. As opposed to the classical, stochastic approaches, the parameters of the proposed controller are selected by minimizing a quadratic cost functional, which ensures an optimal dynamical performance of inventory systems with disparate lead times.},

abstract = {Network reconstruction, i.e., obtaining network structure from data, is a central theme in systems biology, economics, and engineering. Previous work introduced dynamical structure functions as a tool for posing and solving the problem of network reconstruction between measured states. While recovering the network structure between hidden states is not possible since they are not measured, in many situations it is important to estimate the number of hidden states in order to understand the complexity of the network under investigation and help identify potential targets for measurements. Estimating the number of hidden states is also crucial to obtain the simplest state-space model that captures the network structure and is coherent with the measured data. This paper characterises minimal order state-space realisations that are consistent with a given dynamical structure function by exploring properties of dynamical structure functions and developing algorithms to explicitly obtain a minimal reconstruction.},

abstract = {Much of the worlds data is streaming, time-series data, where anomalies give significant information in critical situations. Yet detecting anomalies in streaming data is a difficult task, requiring detectors to process data in real-time, and learn while simultaneously making predictions. We present a novel anomaly detection technique based on an on-line sequence memory algorithm called Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM). We show results from a live application that detects anomalies in financial metrics in real-time. We also test the algorithm on NAB, a published benchmark for real-time anomaly detection, where our algorithm achieves best-in-class results.},

@article{Ramb2013a,
abstract = {In the analysis of neuroscience data, the identification of task-related causal relationships between various areas of the brain gives insights about the network of physiological pathways that are active during the task. One increasingly used approach to identify causal connectivity uses the concept of Granger causality that exploits predictability of activity in one region by past activity in other regions of the brain. Owing to the complexity of the data, selecting components for the analysis of causality as a preprocessing step has to be performed. This includes predetermined-and often arbitrary-exclusion of information. Therefore, the system is confounded by latent sources. In this paper, the effect of latent confounders is demonstrated, and paths of influence among three components are studied. While methods for analysing Granger causality are commonly based on linear vector autoregressive models, the effects of latent confounders are expected to be present also in nonlinear systems. Therefore, all analyses are also performed for a simulated nonlinear system and discussed with regard to applications in neuroscience.},

abstract = {Human FOXP3+CD25+CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) are essential to the maintenance of immune homeostasis. Several genes are known to be important for murine Tregs, but for human Tregs the genes and underlying molecular networks controlling the suppressor function still largely remain unclear. Here, we describe a strategy to identify the key genes directly from an undirected correlation network which we reconstruct from a very high time‐resolution (HTR) transcriptome during the activation of human Tregs/CD4+ T‐effector cells. We show that a predicted top‐ranked new key gene PLAU (the plasminogen activator urokinase) is important for the suppressor function of both human and murine Tregs. Further analysis unveils that PLAU is particularly important for memory Tregs and that PLAU mediates Treg suppressor function via STAT5 and ERK signaling pathways. Our study demonstrates the potential for identifying novel key genes for complex dynamic biological processes using a network strategy based on HTR data, and reveals a critical role for PLAU in Treg suppressor function.Mol Syst Biol. 8: 624},

abstract = {This paper addresses reconstruction of dynamic networks from heterogeneous datasets. The datasets consist of measurements from linear dynamical systems in multiple experiments subjected to different experimental conditions, e.g., changes/perturbations in parameters, disturbance or noise. A main assumption is that the underlying networks share the same Boolean structure in all experiments. The ARMAX model is used as an example to parametrize the general linear network model "dynamical structure function" (DSF), which describes causal interactions between measured variables. Multiple experiment datasets are integrated in one regression problem with additional demands of group sparsity to assure network sparsity and structure consistency. In terms of algorithms for sparse parameter estimation, we introduce the iterative reweighted l1 method (with ADMM for large problems), sparse Bayesian learning and sampling-based methods. Numerical examples benchmark the proposed methods on random sparse ARX network models and DSF models.},

In this paper we show how the design of an optimization algorithm can be cast as a learning problem, allowing the algorithm to learn to exploit structure in the problems of interest in an automatic way. Our learned algorithms, implemented by LSTMs, outperform generic, hand-designed competitors on the tasks for which they are trained, and also generalize well to new tasks with similar structure. We demonstrate this on a number of tasks, including simple convex problems, training neural networks, and styling images with neural art.},

abstract = {It is shown how globally stable model reference adaptive control systems may be designed when one has access to only the plant's input and output signals. Controllers for single input-single output, nonlinear, nonautonomous plants are developed based on Lyapunov's direct method and the Meyer-Kalman-Yacubovich lemma. Derivatives of the plant output are not required, but are replaced by filtered derivative signals. An augmented error signal replaces the error normally used, which is defined as the difference between the model and plant outputs. However, global stability is assured in the sense that the normally used error signal approaches zero asymptotically.},

abstract = {Network reconstruction of dynamical continuous-time (CT) systems is motivated by applications in many fields. Due to experimental limitations, especially in biology, data could be sampled at low frequencies, leading to significant challenges in network inference. We introduce the concept of "system aliasing" and characterize the minimal sampling frequency that allows reconstruction of CT systems from low sampled data. A test criterion is also proposed to check whether system aliasing is presented. With no system aliasing, the paper provides an algorithm to reconstruct dynamic network from data in the presence of noise. In addition, when there is system aliasing we perform studies that add additional prior information of the system such as sparsity. This paper opens new directions in modelling of network systems where samples have significant costs. Such tools are essential to process the available data in applications subject to current experimental limitations.},

abstract = {We propose a formal mathematical model for sparse representations and active dendrites in neocortex. Our model is inspired by recent experimental findings on active dendritic processing and NMDA spikes in pyramidal neurons. These experimental and modeling studies suggest that the basic unit of pattern memory in the neocortex is instantiated by small clusters of synapses operated on by localized non-linear dendritic processes. We derive a number of scaling laws that characterize the accuracy of such dendrites in detecting activation patterns in a neuronal population under adverse conditions. We introduce the union property which shows that synapses for multiple patterns can be randomly mixed together within a segment and still lead to highly accurate recognition. We describe simulation results that provide further insight into sparse representations as well as two primary results. First we show that pattern recognition by a neuron with active dendrites can be extremely accurate and robust with high dimensional sparse inputs even when using a tiny number of synapses to recognize large patterns. Second, equations representing recognition accuracy of a dendrite predict optimal NMDA spiking thresholds under a generous set of assumptions. The prediction tightly matches NMDA spiking thresholds measured in the literature. Our model matches many of the known properties of pyramidal neurons. As such the theory provides a mathematical framework for understanding the benefits and limits of sparse representations in cortical networks.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Elucidating gene regulatory networks is crucial for understanding normal cell physiology and complex pathologic phenotypes. Existing computational methods for the genome-wide "reverse engineering" of such networks have been successful only for lower eukaryotes with simple genomes. Here we present ARACNE, a novel algorithm, using microarray expression profiles, specifically designed to scale up to the complexity of regulatory networks in mammalian cells, yet general enough to address a wider range of network deconvolution problems. This method uses an information theoretic approach to eliminate the majority of indirect interactions inferred by co-expression methods. RESULTS: We prove that ARACNE reconstructs the network exactly (asymptotically) if the effect of loops in the network topology is negligible, and we show that the algorithm works well in practice, even in the presence of numerous loops and complex topologies. We assess ARACNE's ability to reconstruct transcriptional regulatory networks using both a realistic synthetic dataset and a microarray dataset from human B cells. On synthetic datasets ARACNE achieves very low error rates and outperforms established methods, such as Relevance Networks and Bayesian Networks. Application to the deconvolution of genetic networks in human B cells demonstrates ARACNE's ability to infer validated transcriptional targets of the cMYC proto-oncogene. We also study the effects of misestimation of mutual information on network reconstruction, and show that algorithms based on mutual information ranking are more resilient to estimation errors. CONCLUSION: ARACNE shows promise in identifying direct transcriptional interactions in mammalian cellular networks, a problem that has challenged existing reverse engineering algorithms.

We focus on detecting and estimating directed connectivity in neuronal networks using Granger causality (GC) and dynamic causal modelling (DCM). These approaches are considered in the context of functional segregation and integration and--within functional integration--the distinction between functional and effective connectivity. We review recent developments that have enjoyed a rapid uptake in the discovery and quantification of functional brain architectures. GC and DCM have distinct and complementary ambitions that are usefully considered in relation to the detection of functional connectivity and the identification of models of effective connectivity. We highlight the basic ideas upon which they are grounded, provide a comparative evaluation and point to some outstanding issues.},

From the DNS, we can not only obtain the network structure of the system at the measurement level, but also estimate the minimal number of hidden states which are not observed directly. First, we discuss when reconstruction of the DNS is and is not possible. Then, we give an algorithm to find the minimal number of successive outputs to find the DNS. Finally, we discuss extensions of the results to non-linear and noisy systems. These results can be directly applied to the decentralised network control problem of multi-agent systems to find network connections of the observed agents.},

abstract = {In this paper, a novel discrete-time implementation of sliding-mode control systems is proposed, which fully exploits the multivaluedness of the dynamics on the sliding surface. It is shown to guarantee a smooth stabilization on the discrete sliding surface in the disturbance-free case, hence avoiding the chattering effects due to the time-discretization. In addition, when a disturbance acts on the system, the controller attenuates the disturbance effects on the sliding surface by a factor h (where h is the sampling period). Most importantly, this holds even for large h . The controller is based on an implicit Euler method and is very easy to implement with projections on the interval [-1, 1] (or as the solution of a quadratic program). The zero-order-hold (ZOH) method is also investigated. First- and second-order perturbed systems (with a disturbance satisfying the matching condition) without and with dynamical disturbance compensation are analyzed, with classical and twisting sliding-mode controllers.},

In particular, the so-called Integral SMC approach is used to produce a control action aimed to reduce the difference between the nominal predicted dynamics of the closed-loop system and the actual one. In this way, the MPC strategy can be designed on a system with a reduced uncertainty. In order to prove the stability of the overall control scheme, some general regional input-to-state practical stability results for continuous-time systems are proved.},

@article{Lebre2010,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Biological networks are highly dynamic in response to environmental and physiological cues. This variability is in contrast to conventional analyses of biological networks, which have overwhelmingly employed static graph models which stay constant over time to describe biological systems and their underlying molecular interactions. METHODS: To overcome these limitations, we propose here a new statistical modelling framework, the ARTIVA formalism (Auto Regressive TIme VArying models), and an associated inferential procedure that allows us to learn temporally varying gene-regulation networks from biological time-course expression data. ARTIVA simultaneously infers the topology of a regulatory network and how it changes over time. It allows us to recover the chronology of regulatory associations for individual genes involved in a specific biological process (development, stress response, etc.). RESULTS: We demonstrate that the ARTIVA approach generates detailed insights into the function and dynamics of complex biological systems and exploits efficiently time-course data in systems biology. In particular, two biological scenarios are analyzed: the developmental stages of Drosophila melanogaster and the response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to benomyl poisoning. CONCLUSIONS: ARTIVA does recover essential temporal dependencies in biological systems from transcriptional data, and provide a natural starting point to learn and investigate their dynamics in greater detail.},

Moreover, we provide the reader with some intuition for how the algorithm operates and discuss some solutions to numerical problems that might occur in practice. To illustrate the use of PMH, we consider parameter inference in a linear Gaussian SSM with synthetic data and a nonlinear stochastic volatility model with real-world data. We conclude the tutorial by discussing important possible improvements to the algorithm and we also list suitable references for further study.},

@article{Baldwin2005,
abstract = {Resistance welders are a source of voltage fluctuations and flicker in industrial power distribution systems. The high-reactance welding transformer that limits the welding current creates a low-power-factor (pf) load. With hundreds of welders, factories may use synchronized welding cycles that lead to annoying flicker. Other facilities use random timing to prevent flicker, but suffer deep voltage sags due to simultaneous welding operations. Severe voltage variations reduce the power delivered to the welders, causing reduced heating and poor-quality welding joints. The paper examines the design and application of a mini-static var compensator (SVC) to improve the voltage quality on the welding circuits of industrial power distribution systems. The compact range of reactive-power demands for robotic welders suggest the use of thyristor-switched capacitors (TSCs). The compensation provides the necessary voltage control for consistent welds with the added benefit of reduced load currents throughout the industrial distribution system. The compensator control is coupled with the welder controls to mitigate the random reactive-power mismatches that are often seen with other SVC welding and arc-furnace applications.},

For a simple two-state model of glycolysis, we explicitly derive analytic equations for hard trade-offs between robustness and efficiency with oscillations as an inevitable side effect. The model describes how the trade-offs arise from individual parameters, including the interplay of feedback control with autocatalysis of network products necessary to power and catalyze intermediate reactions. We then use control theory to prove that the essential features of these hard trade-off “laws” are universal and fundamental, in that they depend minimally on the details of this system and generalize to the robust efficiency of any autocatalytic network. The theory also suggests worst-case conditions that are consistent with initial experiments.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a sufficient condition that guarantees identifiability of linear network dynamic systems exhibiting continuous-time weighted consensus protocols with acyclic structure. Each edge of the underlying network graph G is defined by a constant parameter, referred to as the weight of the edge, while each node is defined by a scalar state whose dynamics evolve as the weighted linear combination of its difference with the states of its neighboring nodes. Following the classical definitions of identifiability and indistinguishability, we first derive a condition that ensures the identifiability of the edge weights of G in terms of the associated transfer function. Using this characterization, we propose a sensor placement algorithm that guarantees identifiability of the edge weights. We describe our results using illustrative examples.},

abstract = {The correlation of healthy states with heart rate variability (HRV) using time series analyses is well documented. Whereas these studies note the accepted proximal role of autonomic nervous system balance in HRV patterns, the responsible deeper physiological, clinically relevant mechanisms have not been fully explained. Using mathematical tools from control theory, we combine mechanistic models of basic physiology with experimental exercise data from healthy human subjects to explain causal relationships among states of stress vs. health, HR control, and HRV, and more importantly, the physiologic requirements and constraints underlying these relationships. Nonlinear dynamics play an important explanatory role––most fundamentally in the actuator saturations arising from unavoidable tradeoffs in robust homeostasis and metabolic efficiency. These results are grounded in domain-specific mechanisms, tradeoffs, and constraints, but they also illustrate important, universal properties of complex systems. We show that the study of complex biological phenomena like HRV requires a framework which facilitates inclusion of diverse domain specifics (e.g., due to physiology, evolution, and measurement technology) in addition to general theories of efficiency, robustness, feedback, dynamics, and supporting mathematical tools.},

abstract = {Advanced technologies and biology have extremely different physical implementations, but they are far more alike in systems-level organization than is widely appreciated. Convergent evolution in both domains produces modular architectures that are composed of elaborate hierarchies of protocols and layers of feedback regulation, are driven by demand for robustness to uncertain environments, and use often imprecise components. This complexity may be largely hidden in idealized laboratory settings and in normal operation, becoming conspicuous only when contributing to rare cascading failures. These puzzling and paradoxical features are neither accidental nor artificial, but derive from a deep and necessary interplay between complexity and robustness, modularity, feedback, and fragility. This review describes insights from engineering theory and practice that can shed some light on biological complexity.},

@article{Forssell1999,
abstract = {Identification of systems operating in closed loop has long been of prime interest in industrial applications. The problem offers many possibilities, and also some fallacies, and a wide variety of approaches have been suggested, many quite recently. The purpose of the current contribution is to place most of these approaches in a coherent framework, thereby showing their connections and display similarities and differences in the asymptotic properties of the resulting estimates. The common framework is created by the basic prediction error method, and it is shown that most of the common methods correspond to different parameterizations of the dynamics and noise models. The so-called indirect methods, e.g., are indeed “direct” methods employing noise models that contain the regulator. The asymptotic properties of the estimates then follow from the general theory and take different forms as they are translated to the particular parameterizations. We also study a new projection approach to closed-loop identification with the advantage of allowing approximation of the open-loop dynamics in a given, and user-chosen frequency domain norm, even in the case of an unknown, nonlinear regulator.},

However, by proper consideration of the sampling phenomenon in the discrete-time sliding mode control design, the thickness of the boundary layer can be reduced to O(T2).

abstract = {A new discrete-time integral sliding-mode control (DISMC) scheme is proposed for sampled-data systems. The new control scheme is characterized by a discrete-time integral sliding manifold which inherits the desired properties of the continuous-time integral sliding manifold, such as full order sliding manifold with pole assignment, and elimination of the reaching phase. In particular, comparing with existing discrete-time sliding-mode control, the new scheme is able to achieve more precise tracking performance. It will be shown in this work that, the new control scheme achieves O(T2) steady-state error for state regulation with the widely adopted delay-based disturbance estimation. Another desirable feature is, the proposed DISMC prevents the generation of overlarge control actions due to deadbeat response, which is usually inevitable due to the existence of poles at the origin for a reduced order sliding manifold designed for sampled-data systems. Both the theoretical analysis and illustrative example demonstrate the validity of the proposed scheme},

abstract = {Extracting governing equations from data is a central challenge in many diverse areas of science and engineering. Data are abundant whereas models often remain elusive, as in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, and epidemiology, to name only a few examples. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing equations from noisy measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems in an appropriate basis. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. This results in parsimonious models that balance accuracy with model complexity to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this method generalizes to parameterized systems and systems that are time-varying or have external forcing.},

abstract = {Numerous methods have been developed for inferring gene regulatory networks from expression data, however, both their absolute and comparative performance remain poorly understood. In this paper, we introduce a framework for critical performance assessment of methods for gene network inference. We present an in silico benchmark suite that we provided as a blinded, community-wide challenge within the context of the DREAM (Dialogue on Reverse Engineering Assessment and Methods) project. We assess the performance of 29 gene-network-inference methods, which have been applied independently by participating teams. Performance profiling reveals that current inference methods are affected, to various degrees, by different types of systematic prediction errors. In particular, all but the best-performing method failed to accurately infer multiple regulatory inputs (combinatorial regulation) of genes. The results of this community-wide experiment show that reliable network inference from gene expression data remains an unsolved problem, and they indicate potential ways of network reconstruction improvements.},

However, simulating stochastic dynamical systems (SDSs) has not received as much attention. This paper presents a self-contained treatment of how to simulate linear time-invariant CT SDSs with noisy measurements. The system model considered is quite general and avoids many simplifying assumptions generally made in the literature. An analytical solution to a state-space representation of the CT SDS is presented, and numerical approximations to such solution are derived. Moreover, the connection between the CT SDS and a discrete-time (DT) statistically equivalent system is established. Numerical methods for computing the various DT system and noise statistics matrices are discussed. An example is presented to illustrate the application of the various methods discussed in this paper.},

Here, we introduce an approach, WADDINGTON-OT, based on the mathematics of optimal transport, for inferring developmental landscapes, probabilistic cellular fates and dynamic trajectories from large-scale single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data collected along a time course. We demonstrate the power of WADDINGTON-OT by applying the approach to study 65,781 scRNA-seq profiles collected at 10 time points over 16 days during reprogramming of fibroblasts to iPSCs. We construct a high-resolution map of reprogramming that rediscovers known features; uncovers new alternative cell fates including neural- and placental-like cells; predicts the origin and fate of any cell class; highlights senescent-like cells that may support reprogramming through paracrine signaling; and implicates regulatory models in particular trajectories. Of these findings, we highlight Obox6, which we experimentally show enhances reprogramming efficiency. Our approach provides a general framework for investigating cellular differentiation.},

abstract = {The main differences between the designs of discrete-time variable structure systems (VSS) and continuous-time VSS are the determination of the switching hyperplane and the satisfaction of the hitting/sliding condition. These differences yield many difficulties in the design of sliding mode control for the discrete-time VSS. This note tries to overcome these difficulties and design a simple sliding mode control for a single input discrete-time VSS such that not only the discrete-time uncertain system is stabilized robustly, but also the chattering along the sliding mode is reduced explicitly. Instead of the conventional switching hyperplane, in the discrete-time case a “switching region”, which includes the hyperplane S0 and its neighborhood, is determined and used. The determination of the switching region is to locate the equilibrium point of the nominal subsystem on each hyperplane Sp outside the switching region such that the state motions inside and outside the switching region will occur alternately until the state of the closed-loop system reaches the origin. Moreover, we prove that the robustness property is retained whenever the uncertainty satisfies a standard matching condition},

abstract = {A majority of methods from dynamical system analysis, especially those in applied settings, rely on Poincaré's geometric picture that focuses on "dynamics of states." While this picture has fueled our field for a century, it has shown difficulties in handling high-dimensional, ill-described, and uncertain systems, which are more and more common in engineered systems design and analysis of "big data" measurements. This overview article presents an alternative framework for dynamical systems, based on the "dynamics of observables" picture. The central object is the Koopman operator: an infinite-dimensional, linear operator that is nonetheless capable of capturing the full nonlinear dynamics. The first goal of this paper is to make it clear how methods that appeared in different papers and contexts all relate to each other through spectral properties of the Koopman operator. The second goal is to present these methods in a concise manner in an effort to make the framework accessible to researchers who would like to apply them, but also, expand and improve them. Finally, we aim to provide a road map through the literature where each of the topics was described in detail. We describe three main concepts: Koopman mode analysis, Koopman eigenquotients, and continuous indicators of ergodicity. For each concept, we provide a summary of theoretical concepts required to define and study them, numerical methods that have been developed for their analysis, and, when possible, applications that made use of them. The Koopman framework is showing potential for crossing over from academic and theoretical use to industrial practice. Therefore, the paper highlights its strengths in applied and numerical contexts. Additionally, we point out areas where an additional research push is needed before the approach is adopted as an off-the-shelf framework for analysis and design.},

@misc{Hawkins2016,
abstract = {Pyramidal neurons represent the majority of excitatory neurons in the neocortex. Each pyramidal neuron receives input from thousands of excitatory synapses that are segregated onto dendritic branches. The dendrites themselves are segregated into apical, basal, and proximal integration zones, which have different properties. It is a mystery how pyramidal neurons integrate the input from thousands of synapses, what role the different dendrites play in this integration, and what kind of network behavior this enables in cortical tissue. It has been previously proposed that non-linear properties of dendrites enable cortical neurons to recognize multiple independent patterns. In this paper we extend this idea in multiple ways. First we show that a neuron with several thousand synapses segregated on active dendrites can recognize hundreds of independent patterns of cellular activity even in the presence of large amounts of noise and pattern variation. We then propose a neuron model where patterns detected on proximal dendrites lead to action potentials, defining the classic receptive field of the neuron, and patterns detected on basal and apical dendrites act as predictions by slightly depolarizing the neuron without generating an action potential. By this mechanism, a neuron can predict its activation in hundreds of independent contexts. We then present a network model based on neurons with these properties that learns time-based sequences. The network relies on fast local inhibition to preferentially activate neurons that are slightly depolarized. Through simulation we show that the network scales well and operates robustly over a wide range of parameters as long as the network uses a sparse distributed code of cellular activations. We contrast the properties of the new network model with several other neural network models to illustrate the relative capabilities of each. We conclude that pyramidal neurons with thousands of synapses, active dendrites, and multiple integration zones create a robust and powerful sequence memory. Given the prevalence and similarity of excitatory neurons throughout the neocortex and the importance of sequence memory in inference and behavior, we propose that this form of sequence memory may be a universal property of neocortical tissue.},

abstract = {Metagenomics, or sequencing of the genetic material from a complete microbial community, is a promising tool to discover novel microbes and viruses. Viral metagenomes typically contain many unknown sequences. Here we describe the discovery of a previously unidentified bacteriophage present in the majority of published human faecal metagenomes, which we refer to as crAssphage. Its {\~{}}97 kbp genome is six times more abundant in publicly available metagenomes than all other known phages together; it comprises up to 90{\%} and 22{\%} of all reads in virus-like particle (VLP)-derived metagenomes and total community metagenomes, respectively; and it totals 1.68{\%} of all human faecal metagenomic sequencing reads in the public databases. The majority of crAssphage-encoded proteins match no known sequences in the database, which is why it was not detected before. Using a new co-occurrence profiling approach, we predict a Bacteroides host for this phage, consistent with Bacteroides-related protein homologues and a unique carbohydrate-binding domain encoded in the phage genome.},

In this paper the several procedures that have resulted from this research are reviewed and their characteristic properties are compared.

Such variability is rich with information about the cell's underlying gene regulatory networks, their architecture and the parameters of the biochemical reactions at their core.Results: We report a novel method, called Inference for Networks of Stochastic Interactions among Genes using High-Throughput data (INSIGHT), for systematically combining high-throughput time-course flow cytometry measurements with computer-generated stochastic simulations of candidate gene network models to infer the network's stochastic model and all its parameters. By exploiting the mathematical relationships between experimental and simulated population histograms, INSIGHT achieves scalability, efficiency and accuracy while entirely avoiding approximate stochastic methods. We demonstrate our method on a synthetic gene network in bacteria and show that a detailed mechanistic model of this network can be estimated with high accuracy and high efficiency. Our method is completely general and can be used to infer models of signal-activated gene networks in any organism based solely on flow cytometry data and stochastic simulations.Availability: A free C source code implementing the INSIGHT algorithm, together with test data is available from the authors.Contact: mustafa.khammash@bsse.ethz.chSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

@article{Haury2012,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inferring the structure of gene regulatory networks (GRN) from a collection of gene expression data has many potential applications, from the elucidation of complex biological processes to the identification of potential drug targets. It is however a notoriously difficult problem, for which the many existing methods reach limited accuracy. RESULTS: In this paper, we formulate GRN inference as a sparse regression problem and investigate the performance of a popular feature selection method, least angle regression (LARS) combined with stability selection, for that purpose. We introduce a novel, robust and accurate scoring technique for stability selection, which improves the performance of feature selection with LARS. The resulting method, which we call TIGRESS (for Trustful Inference of Gene REgulation with Stability Selection), was ranked among the top GRN inference methods in the DREAM5 gene network inference challenge. In particular, TIGRESS was evaluated to be the best linear regression-based method in the challenge. We investigate in depth the influence of the various parameters of the method, and show that a fine parameter tuning can lead to significant improvements and state-of-the-art performance for GRN inference, in both directed and undirected settings. CONCLUSIONS: TIGRESS reaches state-of-the-art performance on benchmark data, including both in silico and in vivo (E. coli and S. cerevisiae) networks. This study confirms the potential of feature selection techniques for GRN inference. Code and data are available on http://cbio.ensmp.fr/tigress. Moreover, TIGRESS can be run online through the GenePattern platform (GP-DREAM, http://dream.broadinstitute.org).},

@article{Wang2016,
abstract = {Abstract The problem of reconstructing nonlinear and complex dynamical systems from measured data or time series is central to many scientific disciplines including physical, biological, computer, and social sciences, as well as engineering and economics. The classic approach to phase-space reconstruction through the methodology of delay-coordinate embedding has been practiced for more than three decades, but the paradigm is effective mostly for low-dimensional dynamical systems. Often, the methodology yields only a topological correspondence of the original system. There are situations in various fields of science and engineering where the systems of interest are complex and high dimensional with many interacting components. A complex system typically exhibits a rich variety of collective dynamics, and it is of great interest to be able to detect, classify, understand, predict, and control the dynamics using data that are becoming increasingly accessible due to the advances of modern information technology. To accomplish these goals, especially prediction and control, an accurate reconstruction of the original system is required. Nonlinear and complex systems identification aims at inferring, from data, the mathematical equations that govern the dynamical evolution and the complex interaction patterns, or topology, among the various components of the system. With successful reconstruction of the system equations and the connecting topology, it may be possible to address challenging and significant problems such as identification of causal relations among the interacting components and detection of hidden nodes. The “inverse” problem thus presents a grand challenge, requiring new paradigms beyond the traditional delay-coordinate embedding methodology. The past fifteen years have witnessed rapid development of contemporary complex graph theory with broad applications in interdisciplinary science and engineering. The combination of graph, information, and nonlinear dynamical systems theories with tools from statistical physics, optimization, engineering control, applied mathematics, and scientific computing enables the development of a number of paradigms to address the problem of nonlinear and complex systems reconstruction. In this Review, we describe the recent advances in this forefront and rapidly evolving field, with a focus on compressive sensing based methods. In particular, compressive sensing is a paradigm developed in recent years in applied mathematics, electrical engineering, and nonlinear physics to reconstruct sparse signals using only limited data. It has broad applications ranging from image compression/reconstruction to the analysis of large-scale sensor networks, and it has become a powerful technique to obtain high-fidelity signals for applications where sufficient observations are not available. We will describe in detail how compressive sensing can be exploited to address a diverse array of problems in data based reconstruction of nonlinear and complex networked systems. The problems include identification of chaotic systems and prediction of catastrophic bifurcations, forecasting future attractors of time-varying nonlinear systems, reconstruction of complex networks with oscillatory and evolutionary game dynamics, detection of hidden nodes, identification of chaotic elements in neuronal networks, reconstruction of complex geospatial networks and nodal positioning, and reconstruction of complex spreading networks with binary data.. A number of alternative methods, such as those based on system response to external driving, synchronization, and noise-induced dynamical correlation, will also be discussed. Due to the high relevance of network reconstruction to biological sciences, a special section is devoted to a brief survey of the current methods to infer biological networks. Finally, a number of open problems including control and controllability of complex nonlinear dynamical networks are discussed. The methods outlined in this Review are principled on various concepts in complexity science and engineering such as phase transitions, bifurcations, stabilities, and robustness. The methodologies have the potential to significantly improve our ability to understand a variety of complex dynamical systems ranging from gene regulatory systems to social networks toward the ultimate goal of controlling such systems.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a sufficient condition that guarantees identifiability for a class of linear network dynamic systems exhibiting continuous-time weighted consensus protocols. Each edge of the underlying network graph G of the system is defined by a constant parameter, referred to as the weight of the edge, while each node is defined by a scalar state whose dynamics evolve as the weighted linear combination of its difference with the states of its neighboring nodes. Following the classical definition of output distinguishability, we first derive a condition that ensures the identifiability of the edge-weights of G in terms of the associate transfer function. Using this characterization, we propose a sensor placement algorithm that guarantees identifiability of the edge-weights. We describe our results using illustrative examples.},

@article{Brunton2016,
abstract = {Extracting governing equations from data is a central challenge in many diverse areas of science and engineering. Data are abundant whereas models often remain elusive, as in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, and epidemiology, to name only a few examples. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing equations from noisy measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems in an appropriate basis. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. This results in parsimonious models that balance accuracy with model complexity to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this method generalizes to parameterized systems and systems that are time-varying or have external forcing.},

abstract = {A Bayesian formulation of system identification problems has become popular recently; this is mainly due to the introduction of a family of prior descriptions (kernels) which encode structural properties of dynamical systems such as stability. The simplest instance of this kernel prescribes that the impulse response coefficients are independent random variables with exponentially decaying variance. Selecting the most suitable kernel within this class, which involves tuning the rate at which variance decay, is an important step. This paper studies the properties of the so-called “marginal likelihood” approach providing an interpretation in terms of Mean Squared Error properties of the resulting estimators.},

abstract = {Circadian clocks are gene regulatory networks whose role is to help the organisms to cope with variations in environmental conditions such as the day/night cycle. In this work, we explored the effects of molecular noise in single cells on the behaviour of the circadian clock in the plant model species Arabidopsis thaliana. The computational modelling language Bio-PEPA enabled us to give a stochastic interpretation of an existing deterministic model of the clock, and to easily compare the results obtained via stochastic simulation and via numerical solution of the deterministic model. First, the introduction of stochasticity in the model allowed us to estimate the unknown size of the system. Moreover, stochasticity improved the description of the available experimental data in several light conditions: noise-induced fluctuations yield a faster entrainment of the plant clock under certain photoperiods and are able to explain the experimentally observed dampening of the oscillations in plants under constant light conditions. The model predicts that the desynchronization between noisy oscillations in single cells contributes to the observed damped oscillations at the level of the cell population. Analysis of the phase, period and amplitude distributions under various light conditions demonstrated robust entrainment of the plant clock to light/dark cycles which closely matched the available experimental data.},

We show how an ensemble of regression trees can be used to estimate the face's landmark positions directly from a sparse subset of pixel intensities, achieving super-realtime performance with high quality predictions. We present a general framework based on gradient boosting for learning an ensemble of regression trees that optimizes the sum of square error loss and naturally handles missing or partially labelled data. We show how using appropriate priors exploiting the structure of image data helps with ef- ficient feature selection. Different regularization strategies and its importance to combat overfitting are also investi- gated. In addition, we analyse the effect of the quantity of training data on the accuracy of the predictions and explore the effect of data augmentation using synthesized data.},

abstract = {Dynamic network reconstruction has been shown to be challenging due to the requirements on sparse network structures and network identifiability. The direct parametric method (e.g., using ARX models) requires a large amount of parameters in model selection. Amongst the parametric models, only a restricted class can easily be used to address network sparsity without rendering the optimization problem intractable. To overcome these problems, this paper presents a state-space-based method, which significantly reduces the number of unknown parameters in model selection. Furthermore, we avoid various difficulties arising in gradient computation by using the Expectation Minimization (EM) algorithm instead. To enhance network sparsity, the prior distribution is constructed by using the Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL) approach in the M-step. To solve the SBL problem, another EM algorithm is embedded, where we impose conditions on network identifiability in each iteration. In a sum, this paper provides a solution to reconstruct dynamic networks that avoids the difficulties inherent to gradient computation and simplifies the model selection.},

@phdthesis{Balakrishnan1995,
abstract = {Control system design has traditionally been based on a model of the system to be controlled. When the system operates in a stationary or slowly varying environment, controllers designed on the basis of a single fixed or adaptive model perform satisfactorily. As systems become more and more complex, however, a new class of control problems are encountered in which the operating environment changes frequently and abruptly between different contexts. Sudden changes in subsystem dynamics, disturbances which occur in bursts, failures in sensors or actuators, and changes in reference trajectories to be tracked, are examples of different environments in which complex systems must operate. The task of a control system in such problems is to quickly recognize the environment which exists, and rapidly provide the appropriate control action. Conventional robust or adaptive control systems based on a single model cannot provide such a function, and more "intelligent" control methods are required. The thesis proposes a general methodology based on multiple models, switching, and tuning, for dealing with such control problems. Multiple models are used to describe the different environments approximately. Switching is used to select the best model rapidly and tuning is used to further improve its accuracy. Models for newly encountered environments can be learnt as the system is in operation. A theoretical basis for the proposed methodology is provided in the context of model reference control of time-invariant and rapidly switching systems. The methods were applied to simulation examples of control in the presence of changes in subsystem dynamics, aircraft control in the presence of actuator failure, and camera pan angle tracking of maneuverable point targets. These and numerous other simulations presented in the thesis demonstrate that the performance of the proposed methods is far superior to those based on a single model.},

abstract = {This paper deals with $\mu$ problems involving full-structured (rather than block-diagonal) uncertainty, i.e. uncertainty blocks where each sub-block (or element) may be an independent uncertainty. Rearranging this problem into standard (block-diagonal) form results in an explosion in the required computation, and so a number of researchers have proposed more efficient bounds, in particular those based on non-similarity scaling, for such problems. Here we show how to map such problems into reduced size standard $\mu$ problems. The standard bounds applied to the reduced size problem are then shown to be at least as accurate, and require the same computational effort, as earlier techniques, with the added bonus that the standard $\mu$ upper bound is convex. Moreover this new approach is applicable in a much more general setting, allowing one to efficiently compute both robust stability and robust performance for problems involving multiple real and complex uncertainty blocks, any number of which may be full-structured.},

The interaction network is estimated by solving a linear model using simultaneous shrinking of the least absolute weights and the prediction error. RESULTS: The proposed scheme has been applied to the murine C2C12 cell-line stimulated to undergo osteoblast differentiation. Results show that our method discovers genetic interactions that display significant enrichment of co-citation in literature. More detailed study showed that the inferred network exhibits properties and hypotheses that are consistent with current biological knowledge.},

Unlike the conventional methods, we find it possible to detect causality only with very short time series data, based on embedding theory of an attractor for nonlinear dynamics. Specifically, we first show that measuring the smoothness of a cross map between two observed variables can be used to detect a causal relation. Then, we provide a very effective algorithm to computationally evaluate the smoothness of the cross map, or "Cross Map Smoothness" (CMS), and thus to infer the causality, which can achieve high accuracy even with very short time series data. Analysis of both mathematical models from various benchmarks and real data from biological systems validates our method.},

The problem is motivated from a variety of disciplines, but it has recently received considerable attention from the systems biology community in the study of chemical reaction networks. Here, we demonstrate that even when a transfer function can be identified perfectly from input-output data, not even Boolean reconstruction is possible, in general, without more information about the system. We then completely characterize this additional information that is essential for dynamical reconstruction without appeal to ad-hoc assumptions about the network, such as sparsity or minimality.},

abstract = {Critical transitions occur in a wide variety of applications including mathematical biology, climate change, human physiology and economics. A dynamical system that was in a stable state suddenly changes to a distant attractor. Therefore it is highly desirable to find early-warning signs for these critical transitions. Although several different approaches have been proposed for specific models, a detailed mathematical theory has not been developed yet. In this paper we provide another building block of this theory beyond the first results developed in [C. Kuehn. "A mathematical framework for critical transitions: bifurcations, fast-slow systems and stochastic dynamics", submitted, 2010]. We start from classical bifurcation theory and normal forms to classify critical transitions. Using this approach, we proceed to stochastic fluctuations and provided detailed scaling laws of the variance of stochastic sample paths near critical transitions. To show that our theory naturally extends bifurcation theory we apply it to several models: the Stommel-Cessi box model for the thermohaline circulation from geoscience, an epidemic-spreading model on an adaptive network, an activator-inhibitor switch from systems biology, a predator-prey system from ecology and to the Euler buckling problem from classical mechanics. We also hope that our combination of theory and applications for critical transitions opens up new research directions in different disciplines of nonlinear science.},

abstract = {We exploit the key idea that nonlinear system identification is equivalent to linear identification of the socalled Koopman operator. Instead of considering nonlinear system identification in the state space, we obtain a novel linear identification technique by recasting the problem in the infinite-dimensional space of observables. This technique can be described in two main steps. In the first step, similar to the socalled Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition algorithm, the data are lifted to the infinite-dimensional space and used for linear identification of the Koopman operator. In the second step, the obtained Koopman operator is "projected back" to the finite-dimensional state space, and identified to the nonlinear vector field through a linear least squares problem. The proposed technique is efficient to recover (polynomial) vector fields of different classes of systems, including unstable, chaotic, and open systems. In addition, it is robust to noise, well-suited to model low sampling rate datasets, and able to infer network topology and dynamics.},

abstract = {This review focuses on the need for, challenges to, and means of achieving effective control in resistance spot welding; beginning with the earliest single variable open loop systems, progressing to single-, then multivariable feedback and adaptive closed loop systems. The former applied a control action to a single input variable to compensate for drops in line voltage without assessing the effect on output online. The latter use feedback of either single or multiple output variables measured online to execute a preplanned control action, with adaptive systems able to selfadjust gains and/or time constants in the control law in accordance with predictable and unpredictable variations to achieve near constant output. The capabilities and shortcomings of each approach are addressed. The review ends with a discussion of emerging systems for achieving intelligent control by comparing inputs against outputs of actual versus ideal welds and executing control commands in real time based on process knowledge and learning."},

abstract = {This paper describes a simple “high-level” controller called a “supervisor” which is capable of switching into feedback with a SISO process, a sequence of linear positioning or set-point controllers from a family of candidate controllers so as to cause the output of the process to approach and track a constant reference input. The process is assumed to be modeled by a SISO linear system whose transfer function is in the union of a number of subclasses, each subclass being small enough so that one of the candidate controllers would solve the positioning problem if the transfer function of the process were to be one of the subclasses' members. Each subclass contains a “nominal process model transfer function” about which the subclass is centred. It is shown that in the absence of unmodeled process dynamics, the proposed supervisor can successfully perform its function even if process disturbances are present, provided they are bounded and constant},
